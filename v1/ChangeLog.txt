SoilMod - Change log

============================
Post-version 1.2.x

Fixes:

- Removed "force send CutterAreaEvent", as it was causing other problems.

Enhancements:

  
Additions/updates:

- Italian translations by DD ModPassion
- Czech translation of ReadMe by Albi.
- Added a "hidden" 3rd page for the PDA, which can be used for private/custom static text or help.
  The PDAModPlugin_SoilCondition.ZIP's ModDesc.XML file has to be edited, to activate the 3rd page.
- Detect solid spreaders using 'spinners' by Calamarain.
- More/updated Russian translations by Gonimy-Vetrom.


============================
Version 1.2.0

Fixes:

- Front tank for spraying can now be used to spray fertilizer and herbicide.
- If not already set an overlay HUD icon for 'kalk', it will be set by SoilMod.
- Possibility to overwrite the default fruit's relation to fertilizer/herbicide types.
- There was a too high yield when using MoreRealistic equipment.
- Multiplayer, force send CutterAreaEvent if something was cut but modified volume resulted in zero.

Enhancements:

- Some settings can now be changed by the map-script, if the map-author so chooses.
  These are; delayGrowthCycle, reduceWindrows, removeSprayMoisture & disableWithering.
  Look for 'setMapProperty' in the supplied 'SampleModMap - Additions.LUA' script.
- The above mentioned settings will also be stored in the CareerSavegame.XML file.
  They can be changed there too, but unfortunately will NOT work correctly for
  multiplayer sessions, as clients won't be notified of the changes in the savegame.
  
Additions/updates:

- Czech translations by KingFrame & Albi.
- More/updated Russian translations by Gonimy-Vetrom.
- More German translations by webalizer.
- French translations by Marxtai & Dural.
- Removed two of the "difficult to understand instructions" from the 'map - Instructions.txt'.
  Now fileId's and materialId's are pre-set to large numbers.
- Plugin support for other mods, so they can "add" their own effects.
  Documentation with sample plugins is a 'Work-In-Progress' and not finalized.
  For questions and alike, please create an issue at the GitHub repository.


============================
Version 1.1.0

Fixes:

- PDA screen 'Fruit Effects' now scrolls, to reveal more crops.
- Overlay HUD icons should now display, particular for 'kalk'. Also when using the zzz_fillTypeOverlays.zip mod.
- A few hardcoded texts moved to ModDesc.XML, so they can be localized.
- Using the localized names for fruits in PDA screens.

Enhancements:

- PDA screen 'Fruit Effects' split up in columns, and should better illustrate what the crops 'likes' and 'dislikes'.
- ModDesc.XML translations for German (by JakobT) and Russian (by Gonimy_Vetrom & VAHA).
- Overlay HUD icons for fertilizer types A,B,C updated by JakobT.
- Prefixed output in LOG.TXT with "SoilMod:".

Additions:

- Instructions for map & script translated to Russian, by Gonimy_Vetrom & VAHA.

============================
Version 1.0.0

- Initial public version on FS-UK.COM


============================
Version 0.6.1

- REQUIRED change in SampleModMap.LUA, where call to fmcSoilMod.postInit_loadMapFinished() is moved downwards.

- Bug fixes and tweaks for growth control.


============================
Version 0.6.0

- REQUIRED changes in your map's SampleModMap.LUA script.

  Increased to 5 places where to add calls to fmcSoilMod. Look in the supplied script
  'SampleModMap - Additions.LUA' for what to copy and where.

  This was needed, to make sure that the SoilManagement.ZIP mod won't affect any other
  maps which have no support for it.

- Misc. minor changes in the scripts.

- Replaced the lime (kalk) HUD icon, with something differently.

- Updated foliage_weed_diffuse_atlasSize_2.dds.


============================
Version 0.5.x

- Renamed foliage-sub-layers due to avoiding clashing with potential
  existing foliage-sub-layers in a mod-map.

  IMPORTANT!

    If you have a map made with v0.4.x, you MUST DO the following in your
    map.i3d file: Rename the following foliage-sub-layer names for SoilMod,
    so they are prefixed with "fmc_".

    Example:
                          \/                --rename to-->                     \\//
    <FoliageSubLayer name="manure"                -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_manure"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="slurry"                -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_slurry"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="lime"                  -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_lime"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="weed"                  -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_weed"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="fertilizerOrganic"     -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_fertilizerOrganic"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="fertilizerSynthetic"   -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_fertilizerSynthetic"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="herbicide"             -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_herbicide"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="soil_pH"               -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_soil_pH"

- Changed requirements in SampleModMap.LUA, so there are now only 3
  places which needs to be added.

- Added possibility to set custom fruit-type's correlation for
  'fertilizer' and 'herbicide' when using SoilMod in "Advanced Mode".

  This must be set up in the SampleModMap.LUA, as illustrated in the
  sample script.

  Example:
      fmcSoilMod.setFruit_FertilizerBoost_HerbicideAffected("tomato"       , "fertilizer2"    , "herbicide3")
                                                         -- <Name of fruit>, <fertilizer-type>, <herbicide-type>

- Fixed when a fruit-type does not have a corresponding foliage-sub-
  layer, an error would occur calling getDensityMapFileName()

- Fixed attempt at loading savegame0/careerSavegame.xml, when only
  being client.

- Fixed problematic MP event in fmcGrowthControl.LUA being sent/-
  received before client began to run its update() function.


============================
Version 0.4.x

- Initial closed beta test.
